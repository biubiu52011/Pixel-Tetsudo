# Pixel-Tetsudo - Agent Development Rules

This file defines the hard rules for any AI agent working on this project.
These rules take precedence over any per-task instructions.

## System-First Change Rule (HARD RULE)

Any add, modify, or delete operation MUST start from the current full system state, never from the target file alone.

### Before any change
1. Identify the user task this change serves
2. Confirm the current architecture boundary (which module owns what)
3. List all existing Provider/Consumer relationships involved
4. Check for historical implementations, orphan entries, or deprecated paths
5. Design the modification within the system model - not by adapting existing code

### After any structural change
Re-check ALL of the following:

- Provider -> Consumer chain is complete
- No new orphans created
- No old entry point re-referenced
- No duplicate implementation introduced
- No existing module capability degraded
- No A+B temporary fusion forming new ambiguous boundary
- New feature does not incorrectly inherit old framework
- Old feature still retains its original capability after the change

### Critical principle

Can run does not equal correctly integrated into the system.

If a local change conflicts with the system-wide design, redesign the change - never force-adapt the existing code.

## Canonical Data Freeze Rule

The following data is LOCKED. Never modify for any reason:

- data/core/railway_data.json: 156 lines / 509 stations / 1703 name_map / 93 tourism
- Any missing data field is DATA-BLOCKED, not a reason to fabricate content.

## Display Identity Rule

RailwayDB.resolveLineName() / resolveStationName() / tOp() are the ONLY allowed display name paths.
Never implement a second resolver. Never use line.name / line.nameJa / line.nameEn directly in user-visible output.

## Three-Layer Data Architecture Rule

The project uses three intentional layers. Do NOT merge them:

| Layer | Owner | Responsibility |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| UNIFIED_LINES | db-loader.js | Raw canonical line objects (DataFusion input) |
| DataLayer | data-layer.js | Runtime cache (positions, grouped access) |
| RailwayDB | db-loader.js | Canonical query + display identity (i18n) |

Each layer has a distinct responsibility. Use the correct layer for the correct concern.

## No Orphan-Generating Migration Rule

When moving a capability from module A to module B:
1. Identify ALL consumers of A
2. Migrate each consumer to B
3. Verify each consumer works with B
4. Only THEN remove A
5. Run global orphan sweep after removal

Never delete a provider while consumers still reference it.
