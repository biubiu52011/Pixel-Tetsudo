# Pixel-Tetsudo - Agent Development Rules

This file defines the hard rules for any AI agent working on this project.
These rules take precedence over any per-task instructions.

---

## System-First Change Rule (HARD RULE)

Any add, modify, or delete operation MUST start from the current full system state, never from the target file alone.

### Before any change
1. Identify the user task this change serves
2. Confirm the current architecture boundary (which module owns what)
3. List all existing Provider/Consumer relationships involved
4. Check for historical implementations, orphan entries, or deprecated paths
5. Design the modification within the system model - not by adapting existing code

### After any structural change
Re-check ALL of the following:
- Provider -> Consumer chain is complete
- No new orphans created
- No old entry point re-referenced
- No duplicate implementation introduced
- No existing module capability degraded
- No A+B temporary fusion forming new ambiguous boundary
- New feature does not incorrectly inherit old framework
- Old feature still retains its original capability after the change

### Critical principle
Can run does not equal correctly integrated into the system.
If a local change conflicts with the system-wide design, redesign the change - never force-adapt the existing code.

## Development Workflow for New Features (Post RC-2)

Every new feature MUST follow this chain:

1. Read-only system audit (current state from baseline)
2. Check if existing capability can be reused
3. If new capability needed: define Provider boundary clearly
4. Define which module main-heart owns this feature
5. Implement within system boundaries
6. Consumer Chain Audit (all Consumers verified)
7. Future AI Trap Scan (no new misleading entries)
8. Global product walkthrough (no cross-module regression)
9. Release Gate check

Do not skip steps. Do not treat file-level changes as sufficient.

## Known Debt (Do Not Auto-Fix)

| Debt | Priority | Reason for defer |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| History <-> SearchUI coupling (P2) | P2 | Requires SearchUI public API redesign |
| data/铁道/ directory (P3) | P3 | Historical archive, zero runtime impact |
| CSS orphan classes (5) | P3 | Low risk, covered by inheritance |
| console.log in odpt-unified.js (2) | P3 | Non-product debug output |
| 13 image path fixes | Deferred | Asset mapping, no product impact |

## Architecture Baselines

| Tag | Commit | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| RC-1 | 63b388d | Engineering baseline: Display Identity unified, P0-3=0 |
| RC-2 | pending | Product baseline: Architecture documented, rules enforced |

## Canonical Data Freeze Rule
The following data is LOCKED. Never modify for any reason:
- data/core/railway_data.json: 156 lines / 509 stations / 1703 name_map / 93 tourism
- Any missing data field is DATA-BLOCKED, not a reason to fabricate content.

---

## Display Identity Rule
RailwayDB.resolveLineName() / resolveStationName() / tOp() are the ONLY allowed display name paths.
Never implement a second resolver. Never use line.name / line.nameJa / line.nameEn directly in user-visible output.

---

## Three-Layer Data Architecture Rule
The project uses three intentional layers. Do NOT merge them:
| Layer | Owner | Responsibility |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| UNIFIED_LINES | db-loader.js | Raw canonical line objects (DataFusion input) |
| DataLayer | data-layer.js | Runtime cache (positions, grouped access) |
| RailwayDB | db-loader.js | Canonical query + display identity (i18n) |
Each layer has a distinct responsibility. Use the correct layer for the correct concern.

---

## No Orphan-Generating Migration Rule
When moving a capability from module A to module B:
1. Identify ALL consumers of A
2. Migrate each consumer to B
3. Verify each consumer works with B
4. Only THEN remove A
5. Run global orphan sweep after removal
Never delete a provider while consumers still reference it.
---

## Read-Only First Rule
Every review/audit phase starts with read-only analysis. Code changes only after explicit approval.

---

## Module Main-Heart Rule
Each page has exactly ONE main heart:
| Page | Main Heart |
|------|-----------|
| Home | Route Search |
| Route Search | How do I get there? |
| Realtime | Can I ride this line now? |
| Trains | What is this line? |
| History | What did I search before? |
| Tourism | What is worth visiting at the destination? |
No module may hijack another module main heart.

---

## Release Gate Rule
Before tagging a release:
1. Run Preflight check (git status, canonical data, script integrity, provider health)
2. Write System-First Change Rule update if architecture evolved
3. Commit rule update BEFORE tagging
4. Tag on the new commit (not on old HEAD)
5. Push main branch + tag together
